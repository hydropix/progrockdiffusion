# Prog Rock Diffusion
A command line version of [Disco Diffusion](https://github.com/alembics/disco-diffusion) for still image generation.
*Animations are not currently supported.*

In addition to Disco Diffusion's great features, Prog Rock has the following benefits:

- Uses your own hardware
- GPU and CPU modes are supported (note: CPU mode is quite slow)
- Works offline (once the required files are downloaded). No more colab disconnects!
- Can be invoked from a script or batch file for mass unattended batches
- Multiple partial settings files are supported, allowing you to layer settings
- Some variables can be randomized to help you explore the possible outputs of a prompt
- If you put \_artist\_ in your prompt, it will be replaced with a randomly selected artist
- Adding --gobig to your command will automatically upscale the result by slicing it and re-rendering those slices
- Optional automatic brightness and contrast fixing (save you from those blown-out results!)

# [Requirements]
- GPU: An Nvidia GPU is *highly* recommended! The speed improvement is massive. 8gb is probably the minimum amount of GPU memory. This author has an RTX 3080 with 10gb and it runs fairly well, but some advanced features are not possible with "only" 10gb. As for AMD cards, I have not had a chance to test one. If you're interested in helping me figure out if it's possible, drop me a note in the issues page.
- CPU: For CPU mode, you will need at least 16gb of RAM.
- STORAGE: you'll need at least 40gb of free disk space, depending on which models you enable.

# [Installation]
Follow the appropriate guide for your platform:
## [Linux](INSTALL-Linux.md)
## [Windows](INSTALL-Windows.md)
## [MacOS](INSTALL-MacOS.md)

# [HOW-TO]

NOTE: On your first run it might appear to hang. Let it go for a good while, though, as it might just be downloading models.
Somtimes there is no feedback during the download process (why? Who knows)

CD to the directory where you installed ProgRockDiffusion. Now you're ready!

The simplest way to run it is:

[Linux]
```
python3 prd.py
```
[Windows and MacOS]
```
python prd.py
```
This will generate an image using the settings from "settings.json", which you could edit to adjust the defaults (or, better yet, make a copy of it and tell prd to use an alternative settings file using the command line arguments below).

**Note: On windows you'll type "python" instead of "python3" in the commands below.**

```
usage: python3 prd.py [-h] [-s SETTINGS] [-o OUTPUT] [-p PROMPT]

Generate images from text prompts.
By default, the supplied settings.json file will be used.
You can edit that, and/or use the options below to fine tune:

Optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s SETTINGS, --settings SETTINGS
                        A settings JSON file to use, best to put in quotes
                        Can be specified more than once to layer settings on top of one another
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        What output directory to use within images_out
  -p PROMPT, --prompt PROMPT
                        Override the prompt
  -i, --ignoreseed
                        Use a random seed instead of what is in your settings file

  -c, --cpu CORES
                        Force CPU mode, and (optionally) specify how many threads to run.

  --cuda DEVICE-ID
                        Specify which CUDA device ID to use for rendering (default: 0).

  -g PERCENT, --geninit PERCENT:
                        Will save an image called geninit.png at PERCENT of overall steps, for use with --useinit

  -u, --useinit:
                        Forces use of geninit.png as an init_image starting at 20% of defined steps.

Usage examples:

To use the Default output directory and settings from settings.json:
 python3 prd.py

To use your own settings.json file (note that putting it in quotes can help parse errors):
 python3 prd.py -s "some_directory/mysettings.json"

Note that multiple settings files are allowed. They're parsed in order. The values present are applied over any previous value:
 python3 prd.py -s "some_directory/mysettings.json" -s "highres.json"

To quickly just override the output directory name and the prompt:
 python3 prd.py -p "A cool image of the author of this program" -o Coolguy

Multiple prompts with weight values are supported:
 python3 prd.py -p "A cool image of the author of this program" -p "Pale Blue Sky:.5"

You can ignore the seed coming from a settings file by adding -i, resulting in a new random seed

To force use of the CPU for image generation, add a -c or --cpu (warning: VERY slow):
 python3 prd.py -c

To specify which CUDA device to use (advanced) by device ID (default is 0):
 python3 prd.py --cuda 1

```
Simply edit the settings.json file provided, or BETTER YET copy it and make several that include your favorite settings.
*Note that multiple settings files can be specified in your command*, and they'll be loaded in order.
Settings.json is **always loaded**, and any specified after that are layered on top (they only need to contain the settings you want to tweak).
For example you could have a settings file that just contains a higher width, height, and more steps, for when you want to make a high-quality image.
Layer that on top of your regular settings and it will apply those values without changing anything else.

## Tips and Troubleshooting
### Get a random artist
In your prompt, if you use \_artist\_ instead of an artists name, an artist will be picked at random from artists.txt

### If you get an error about pandas needing a different verison of numpy, you can try:
```
pip install --force-reinstall numpy
```
### If you are getting "OMP: Error #15: Initializing libiomp5md.dll, but found libiomp5md.dll already initialized"
This seems to be because of a Pytorch compiling bug for Intel CPUs.
You can set an environment variable that will fix this, either on your machine (if you know how to do that), or by editing prd.py.
To do it by editing prd.py, find the line that says "import os" and add the following right below it:
```
os.environ['KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK']='True'
```

### Switch between GPU and CPU modes
This is an advanced technique and requires some expertise. The main issue is you need to be able to switch between two pytorch versions. The easiest way to accomplish that is to do your install twice, each within a separate conda environment using Anaconda. I leave it up to you to learn how to do that.
Once you've installed Anaconda and re-installed ProgRockDiffusion within a conda environment, you can create a second environment that is a clone of the first, but with a different pytorch, like so:

Clone your existing conda environment:
```
conda create --name prdcpu --clone progrockdiffusion
conda activate prdcpu
```
Now install the CPU version of pytorch:
```
pip install -r requirements.cpu.txt
```
All set! You can now switch between the two by simply doing:
```
conda activate progrockdiffusion
conda activate prdcpu
```
